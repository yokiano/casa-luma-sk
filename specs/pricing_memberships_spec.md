# Play Café — Pricing & Memberships Spec
**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2025‑10‑02  
**Scope:** Static content & layout spec for website and print. No checkout/logic in this version.

---

## 1) Purpose & Audience
- **Goal:** Publish a clear, warm, family‑oriented pricing page for a community play café in Koh Phangan (tourists + resident expat families).  
- **Secondary goals:** Encourage longer commitments (10‑Day / Monthly / Yearly), drive F&B spend, and promote workshops and birthday parties.  
- **Keep options simple:** Only **three memberships by duration** + **pay‑as‑you‑go**. No confusing tiers.
- **Tone & style:** Avoid SaaS/tech‑startup template look. Present offers in a **natural, welcoming, holistic style** — earthy colors, playful icons, warm typography. Think “community noticeboard” or “family café menu,” not “software pricing table.”

## 4) UI & Layout Requirements (Framework‑agnostic)

### 4.1 Page Structure (Top → Bottom)
1. **Hero / Heading**: “Memberships & Passes” + a friendly line like *“Play, learn, and laugh together.”*  
2. **Memberships Section**: Three items laid out horizontally or vertically with **illustrative icons** (e.g., ticket, calendar, sun/tree) instead of tech badges.  
3. **Pay‑As‑You‑Go Section**: Three items styled like a **family café blackboard menu** — hand‑drawn dividers, soft colors.  
4. **Notes Section**: Workshops policy, socks, re‑entry.  
5. **CTA Area**: Buttons/links, but styled more like **inviting tags** than corporate CTAs.

### 4.2 Visual Style
- **Theme:** Earthy, natural, playful — warm backgrounds (beige, pastel), hand‑drawn or illustrated icons.  
- **Typography:** Friendly serif or rounded sans; avoid corporate bold condensed fonts.  
- **Layout:** Cards can look more like **noticeboard panels** or **menu chalkboards** rather than glossy SaaS columns.  
- **Emphasis:** Instead of “Most Popular” ribbons, use **gentle highlight** like a sunburst illustration or handwritten “great for families” note.  
- **Imagery:** Watercolor textures, leaf motifs, soft shapes.

### 4.3 Tone & Copy
- **Language:** Warm and inviting, e.g., “A perfect choice for visiting families” rather than “Tourist‑friendly.”  
- **Call to Action:** Replace corporate “Join Now” with playful “Let’s Play”, “Grab a Pass”, or “Come Play With Us”.  
- **Perks:** Framed as experiences (e.g., “Plenty of time to play, snack, and rest” instead of just “Unlimited play”).

## 6) Print Adaptation Notes

- Footer with socks policy, workshops disclaimer, contact details, QR to website.
