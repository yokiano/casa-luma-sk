# Overview

## design philosophy
try to avoid templatish design, like chip/s elements or boring border-radius, it is not an app. it is a marketing website. it needs to attract potential parents, modern age, eclectic vibe, gen Y but classy ones. 
- Natural, warm, and inviting
- Easy navigation for parents
- Focus on imagery and simplicity
- Clean and uncluttered
- none-template looking. creative design.
- Montessori-inspired minimalism
- don't use emojis! we don't do that here.

## Stack and Coding Style

- We use tailwindcss for styling. always! no need for scoped styles unless very much needed.
- We use shadcn/svelte for UI components. Whenever possible of course. if need to install new components, do it.


## Coding mistakes to avoid

- You are trying to fetch environment variables using process.env. Instead, import from $env/static/private. it is supported by SvelteKit.
- We shuld avoid using $effect. it is mostly not necessary. use $derived instead. $effect is ONLY (well mostly) for cases where there is a side effect that needs to be triggered by a state change.
