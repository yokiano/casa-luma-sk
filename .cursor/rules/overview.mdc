# Overview

## design philosophy
try to avoid templatish design, like chip/s elements or boring border-radius, it is not an app. it is a marketing website. it needs to attract potential parents, modern age, eclectic vibe, gen Y but classy ones. 
- Natural, warm, and inviting
- Easy navigation for parents
- Focus on imagery and simplicity
- Clean and uncluttered
- none-template looking. creative design.
- Montessori-inspired minimalism
- don't use emojis! we don't do that here.
