# Project Offer: CFAI Directory

**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Client:** CFAI Project Team  
**Developer:** Yarden

## 1. Project Scope
Development of a professional directory website to showcase industry companies and solutions. The platform will be fast, responsive, and easy to manage.

**Core Features:**
*   **Company Directory:** A visual grid layout displaying companies/startups.
*   **Smart Filtering:** Category-based filtering to easily navigate different sectors.
*   **Search Functionality:** Real-time search to find specific companies or keywords.
*   **Detailed Views:** Modal/Pop-up interface for viewing full company details without leaving the page.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized experience for both Mobile and Desktop users.
*   **RTL Support:** Built from the ground up for Hebrew language support.

## 2. Content Management (Database)
*   **Platform:** We will use **Airtable** as the content management system (CMS).
*   **Workflow:** The client will update data (companies, descriptions, tags, etc.) directly in Airtable. The website will automatically reflect these changes.

## 3. Hosting & Deployment Options
Please choose one of the following deployment methods:

**Option 1: Managed Hosting (Recommended)**
*   Hosted on my Vercel account for maximum performance and reliability.
*   The site will be embedded (e.g., via iframe) into your existing WordPress website.
*   **Cost:** $200 USD / year.
*   **Includes:** Hosting costs, uptime monitoring, technical support, and fixes for any platform-related errors.

**Option 2: WordPress Integration (Web Component)**
*   The project will be bundled as a standalone Web Component.
*   Files will be served directly from your WordPress server.
*   **Additional Cost:** $700 USD (One-time setup fee).
*   **Note:** This covers the complex setup required to bundle the modern app into a legacy environment. Future updates will require more manual steps compared to Option 1.
